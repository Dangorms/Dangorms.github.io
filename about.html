<p>I started as a college basketball player only worrying about sports and training my whole life, until I realized just getting a business degree wasn't going to make me happy when my athletic career was over. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, for awhile. Until I thought of an app idea and thought to myself how much do I have to pay someone to make this for me. Then I realized why not just learn how to make it on my own. This was the point when I became interested in coding. I researched different ways of how to learn. The more I researched, the more I loved the idea of being able to create anything I thought of with just a key board, a computer screen, and the knowledge I will gain from Flatiron. </p>
