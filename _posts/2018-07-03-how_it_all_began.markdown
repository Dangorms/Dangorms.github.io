For most of my life I was only focused on one thing, which was basketball. I spent most of my free time either practicing or watching, because I was obsessed. I never really was thinking about what I actually wanted to do with my life and figured I would just play basketball in college and get a degree in business like everyone else who didn't really know what they wanted. Once college came, after the basketbal season it kind of hit me that I obviously wasn't good enough to make basketball a career. I also hated every business class I was taking. So I was lost and was bouncing around other ideas in my head of what I wanted to do. It wasn't untill I quit basketball and transfered to a school back home and thought of an app idea, that got me interested in learning code. It came to a point when I was trying to figure out how much I'd have to pay someone to make the app for me.
This is when I realized I should just learn to make it myself. So began the journey of researching how to learn coding. The more I researched, the more I became aware of the opportunities and possibilities learning code can bring. I loved the idea of being able to create something that the world can see and use just from typing on a keyboard. This is what led me to where I am today as a part of the Flatiron School.
